# TODO

Very simple todo app

- Backend - SpringBoot
- UI - React
  - tailwind for style

## More to come

Plan is to build out UI, then backend, then dockerize the whole shebang

## Right now though

### Todo

- Switch to Typescript eventually

### In progress

- Working to see if RTK or React Query is a better method of integrating with backend


### Complete

- Got basic UI and integration with backend working
